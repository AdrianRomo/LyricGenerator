# Objective
<table>
<tr>

    Create a support tool for students or fans interested in this field who find it difficult to compose new musical lyrics of a single musical genre due to lack of creativity, lack of knowledge in the structure of the genre or do not have enough inspiration to be able to create new
songs, this in order to boost the career of future artists in the music industry who do not have enough resources to be able to hire particular services of composers.
